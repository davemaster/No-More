# No-More
Note the presence of a gun near You.

## Inspiration
News on television/social networks about massacres using fire arms by mad people.

## What it does
Smartphones, guns (prototype with **smart-trigger**) send their locations by tweet, then, they can be tracked and alarm if the gun devices is near You.

## How we built it
Android phone wit **No More app** (iPhone in future) send tweet (with ist location in it), as well as the gun with **smart-trigger**.

## Challenges we ran into
Send location by tweet from Android app programmed using **Mit App Inventor (quick way to program phone)** and make the smart-trigger, send a tweet using **Twitter API** v2 using a microcontroller or esp8266/esp32 boards (these last, with WiFi build-in capability).

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
If the **smart-trigger prototype** works as be expected, it will be a great goal to show this prototype as an example to all fire arms manufacturers so it can be included in their guns for the civil users market

## What we learned

## What's next for NO MORE
